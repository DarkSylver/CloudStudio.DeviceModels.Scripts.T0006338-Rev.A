function parseUplink(device, payload)
{
	// This function allows you to parse the received payload, and store the 
	// data in the respective endpoints. Learn more at https://wiki.cloud.studio/page/200

	// The parameters in this function are:
	// - device: object representing the device that produced the payload. 
	//   You can use "device.endpoints" to access the collection 
	//   of endpoints contained within the device. More information
	//   at https://wiki.cloud.studio/page/205
	// - payload: object containing the payload received from the device. More
	//   information at https://wiki.cloud.studio/page/208.

	// This example is written assuming a temperature and humidity sensor that 
	// sends a binary payload with temperature in the first byte, humidity 
	// in the second byte, and battery percentage in the third byte.

*  
	// Payload is binary, so it's easier to handle as an array of bytes
	var bytes = payload.asBytes();
	
	// Verify payload contains exactly 3 bytes
	if (bytes.length != 3)
		return;

	// Parse and store temperature
	var temperatureSensor = device.endpoints.byType(endpointType.temperatureSensor);
	if (temperatureSensor != null)
	{
		var temperature = bytes[0] & 0x7f;
		if (bytes[0] & 0x80)  // Negative temperature?
			temperature -= 128;
		temperatureSensor.updateTemperatureSensorStatus(temperature);
	}

	// Parse and store humidity
	var humiditySensor = device.endpoints.byType(endpointType.humiditySensor);
	if (humiditySensor != null)
	{
		var humidity = bytes[1];
		humiditySensor.updateHumiditySensorStatus(humidity);
	}	  
	
	// Parse and store battery percentage
	var batteryPercentage = bytes[2];
	device.updateDeviceBattery({ percentage: batteryPercentage });

{ 
	// This function allows you to convert a command from the platform 
	// into a payload to be sent to the device.
	// Learn more at https://wiki.cloud.studio/page/200

	// The parameters in this function are:
	// - device: object representing the device to which the command will
	//   be sent. 
	// - endpoint: endpoint object representing the endpoint to which the 
	//   command will be sent. May be null if the command is to be sent to 
	//   the device, and not to an individual endpoint within the device.
	// - command: object containing the command that needs to be sent. More
	//   information at https://wiki.cloud.studio/page/1195.

	// This example is written assuming a device that contains a single endpoint, 
	// of type appliance, that can be turned on, off, and toggled. 
	// It is assumed that a single byte must be sent in the payload, 
	// which indicates the type of operation.
